Hi! I'm Brian (Sung Joon) Lee.

I'm an incoming second-year PhD student in Organizational Behavior at the Gies College of Business, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My current research focuses on how people evaluate creative ideas, particularly the subtle psychological and social mechanisms that influence why some ideas are embraced while others are dismissed. I am currently collaborating with Dr. Jeffrey Loewenstein and Dr. Jack Goncalo. 

My work has been recognized with awards such as the Kenneth Uhl Prize for best paper in a doctoral course and the Best Speaker Award at the 2025 Business Administration Doctoral Workshop. I also co-organize the Community of Organizational Scholars at Illinois (COSI), a student-led seminar that fosters a supportive environment for scholars of organizational phenomena across various social science disciplines.

Prior to my PhD, I studied both Political Science and Communication Arts (Communication Science and Rhetoric) at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. Go Badgers!
